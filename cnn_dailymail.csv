He will push those who are already in his position. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti snapped Silva up for a fee believed to be £11.5million . 'He will need to adapt now to a new formation but I am sure he will develop a lot alongside the quality at Real Madrid.' Real were weakened in midfield with the departure of Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich ahead of this season and there has been a lot of pressure on Kroos as Ancelotti has used alternatives Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi sparingly. Sami Khedira (left) is expected to leave Madrid in the summer. Asier Illarramendi (right) could also exit the club . Khedira is in a contractual dispute with Real and is expected to leave at the end of this season while Illarramendi has failed to progress as predicted following a big money move from Real Sociedad. Ancelotti has said publicly that Illarramendi remains an important member of his squad but he has struggled to impose himself in the midfield when he has had chances. Silva's arrival could prompt his departure with Athletic Bilbao favourites to sign him.

'I think of myself as an artist - the works of some of our greatest artists have celebrated every-day mundane things like Andy Warhol's can of soup or Tracy Emin's unmade bed. 'It might make me a bit dull but I love things post boxes - I see them as crimson iconic receptacles. 'And I am recording a slice of British history which is fast disappearing. 'People aren't using post boxes and telephone kiosks theses days because of emails and mobile phones.' Kevin has appeared in a calendar himself - he was Mr January in one featuring Britain's most dull men. He has previously published calendars called the Best of Britain's roundabouts and the Best of Britain's prisons. Kevin said: 'I live in Redditch which must be the most boring town in Britain and I've been married and divorced three times.

He was eventually cornered under a dumpster but it still took another 45 minutes before he was coaxed into a cage. Robinson was arrested on Monday and appeared at Brooklyn Criminal Court the following day. The cat was kicked into a bush during the incident," but a team from the North Shore Animal League managed to track him down after arriving at the Brooklyn housing complex on Tuesday . In the video a man can be seen to kick a cat before laughing and celebrating with a dance. An NYPD source told the New York Post: 'We were able to identify him as part of an investigation behind the video. 'People who saw were really disturbed by it.' One of the first steps was identifying the area of New York where the attack occurred. One . Facebook user used video enhancing software to blow up the scene and . see details that later led police to identify the scene of the crime as a complex in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Residents of the housing complex told police the stray cat was a fixture in the area.""","""Police claim Andre Robinson was filmed kicking the gray cat into bushes ."

000 people a year if the targets had been set by the Food Standards Agency in 2010.’ Professor Graham MacGregor said meddling by ex-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured) meant vital salt reduction targets - which should have been introduced four years ago - have only just been agreed . Mr Lansley took responsibility for public nutrition away from the FSA in 2010 and gave it to the Department of Health. Prof MacGregor claimed this ‘basically caused chaos’. He said that Mr Lansley also ‘adamantly refused’ to set a rolling target for reduction in the 2010-2014 period – leading to ‘a loss of momentum’. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Far from lacking momentum," the World Health Organisation has said our salt reduction work is world leading.’""","""Prof Graham MacGregor said meddling by ex-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley meant vital salt reduction targets have only just been agreed ."

 Mr Gove and . [Health Secretary] Andrew Lansley," how you plan to change that? Two out . of five kids are obese. What is in your arsenal? The fact is they are . doing nothing.’ Campaign: Jamie's Return to School Dinners saw the TV chef continue his push to improve children's nutrition . The Local Authority Caterers’ Association said it was aware of bad habits creeping in which had not . been seen since standards for secondary school meals were introduced in . 2009. Confident: Michael Gove has resisted forcing academies to adopt the strict rules on nutrition for pupils . National chairman Lynda Mitchell said: . ‘I’ve come across an academy school where pupils have been allowed to . go through with a plate of chips and a piece of cake. ‘It is about high volumes of pupils . and turning a profit.’ She also said she had seen several examples of . vending machines in academies selling confectionery. Oliver said head teachers ‘need some . expertise and guidance’. ‘It is there. It exists. Why not make it apply . to all schools?’ he said. The Department for Education said: ‘We trust schools to act in the best interests of their pupils. ‘The tough nutrition standards remain in place in maintained schools and set a clear benchmark for the rest.’ Government-commissioned research into academy meals will be published in the next few weeks.""","""Oliver say healthy eating guideline opt out is lowering nutrition levels among youngsters ."

 and Lambert should be picked ahead of him . Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa . Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class," but he is better than the alternatives . Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season.""","""Rickie Lambert has barely played since joining from Southampton ."

 the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick," touching the ball down with inches to spare. Ryan Hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter.""","""Wigan exact revenge on St Helens in Super League Grand-Final rematch ."

While some gene association studies on noise-induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past," all were very small and their results unreplicated.

The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics. An earlier version of this piece existed but has now been amended.""","""Research was conducted at the University of Southern California ."

At a hearing with Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina in 2013 he said: 'Since the Russian authorities got away with this murder they continue the practice. They encourage the Soviet regime to continue murdering people. 'It's like giving them a licence to kill," like announcing a season for hunting.' In 2004 he was one of the founders of the Committee 2008 whose purpose is to ensure free and fair elections in Russia.

"013 . Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish. Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home. Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing. Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick. Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about. Pitman (centre) runs away in celebration as the Blackpool players watch on in frustration at Goldsands . He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes. A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box. But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes. The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine. Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half. Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick. Blackpool manager Lee Clark instructs his side during the comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth . Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes. Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off. Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go. Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort. The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands. Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick. The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.""","""27-year-old scored a first-half hat-trick to put 3-0 up at the break .",

" Barca would leave themselves open on the break. Ronaldo was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing Barcelona’s defenders. The rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position. Ronaldo looks dejected as he leaves the field after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League in 2011 . The plan may well have worked to perfection but Pepe was sent off in the second half after clashing with Dani Alves and against 10 men Messi scored twice to leave Real with no chance in the second leg. Mourinho recovered his players’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in Spain. Opinion is still divided over his legacy. One television station in Spain suggested this week that Mourinho was among three candidates to replace Ancelotti along with Zinedine Zidane and Jurgen Klopp. Others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return. The purists tut-tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of Barcelona’s 20-pass moves to goal. But it worked because Madrid and Mourinho won. It’s when it no longer works - as it didn’t for Chelsea on Wednesday - is it really called into question.""","""Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last-16 by PSG .",

 pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty. French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012. The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum," the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground. In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin. When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'. Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles. In Call of Duty gamers are armed with an arsenal of weapons and encouraged to take part in violence .""","""Letter sent to parents warning about children playing computer games ."
