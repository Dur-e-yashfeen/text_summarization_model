# Text Summarization Report

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a system that summarizes lengthy articles, blogs, or news into concise summaries using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.

## Dataset Description and Preprocessing Steps

### Dataset Description
The CNN/Daily Mail dataset is a large-scale dataset used for text summarization tasks. It contains articles from the CNN and Daily Mail websites along with their corresponding summaries.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset was loaded using the `datasets` library.
2. **Text Cleaning**: The text data was cleaned by removing unnecessary characters and special symbols.
3. **Prepare Data for Model**: The articles and summaries were tokenized and prepared for input to the pre-trained model.

## Model Implementation with Rationale for Selection

### Model Implemented
- **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)**: BART is a transformer-based model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks. It is particularly effective for text summarization due to its ability to handle both extractive and abstractive summarization.

### Rationale for Selection
- **BART**: Selected for its strong performance in text summarization tasks and its availability as a pre-trained model in the HuggingFace transformers library.

## Key Insights and Visualizations

### Model Performance
- The pre-trained BART model was able to generate coherent and concise summaries from lengthy articles.
- Fine-tuning the model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset further improved the quality of the summaries.

### Test on Real-world Articles
- The model was tested on real-world articles from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, and the generated summaries were evaluated for coherence and relevance.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenges
1. **Handling Long Articles**: The model has a maximum input length, which required truncating long articles.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluating the quality of summaries is subjective and challenging.

### Solutions
1. **Handling Long Articles**: Implemented truncation and ensured that the most relevant parts of the article were included in the input.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Used human judgment and evaluation metrics like ROUGE to assess the quality of the summaries.

## Conclusion
The text summarization system was successfully implemented using the BART model and fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The model is capable of generating concise and coherent summaries from lengthy articles, providing a valuable tool for summarizing text in real-world applications.
